The pipeline is for the analysis of multiplexed bulk RNA-seq data in C. elegans; the barcode/UMI structure follows celSeq method. The input are fastq files generated by bcl2fastq.

Steps:

1. extract valid reads by extractValidReads.py. this scripts extract R1 with valid cell barcode (allow 1 mismatch) and attach the cell barcode&UMI to the header of corresponding R2;
2. For Quality Control, we use FastQC, Picard, RSEQC to create qc outputs.
3. A STAR pipeline to align valid reads to the genome. This module includes Quality Control and Genome Alignment using STAR
4. A ESAT module to count reads for each feature

##### Inputs:

-   a) Paired Reads: output of Bcl2fastq software which has a structure as shown at below.

```
S1_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz
S1_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz
```

-   b) cellBarcodeFile: Valid Barcode File for valid cell barcode extraction.

```
s3://viafoundry/run_data/genome_data_other/CelSeq/bcSet_full.txt
```

##### Outputs:

_UMI table: The output file (`${name}_umi_count_.txt`) is tab separated gene/transcript vs cell_Barcode matrix filled with count data as shown at the example below.

   | gene  | ATCAATCGCGAACCGA | ACCCTCAACTCAAACA | ACTCATACCCGGAAAT |
   |-------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
   | RNF14 | 0                | 0                | 0                |
   | MZT2B | 0                | 12               | 0                |
   | SPN   | 0                | 2                | 8                |
